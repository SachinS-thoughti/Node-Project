# My Node.js Application

This is a simple Node.js application that [briefly describe what your application does].

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database server installed and running.

## Configuration

To configure this application, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

2. Inside the `.env` file, add the following environment variables with their respective values:

- `PORT`: The port on which the application will run.

- `APP_URL`: The URL at which the application can be accessed.
